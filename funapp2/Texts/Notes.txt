October 31/18 Notes:


Reactive Form:

-- Max switches to reactive approach because it allows more "advanced features", he's able to make his own validators
--> Form is now created "programaticly" meaning starting by declaring the form variable "form: formGroup;". formGroup group's all of the controls in a form, you can also have sub groups.
--> initialize "form" under ngOnInit()-- or wherever appropriate for use case -- "this.form = new FormGroup({ "args" })".
--> ex of initialization:

this.form = new FormGroup({
  'title': new FormControl(null, {validators:[
  Validators.required, Validators.minLeanght(3)]})
  'content' = "" ^
});

-- to prepopulated a field w/ existing data use form.setValue(), ex:

this.form.setValue({
  'title' = this.post.title,
  'content' = this.post.content
})
-- to reset for w/ reactive method: this.form.reset()

-- Linking HTML to component:
<form [formGroup] = "form" (submit) = "onSavePost">
<input type = "text" formControlName = "title">
// not wrapped in squeare brackets because we're just passing a string. (? title is a var like form)
//getting invalid status for above input:
<span *ngIf = "form.get('title').invalid> sumnt </span>

-- .setValue() allows you "to set values of ALL inputs/controls of your form"
-- .patchValue is a more targeted approach, allowing for single variable value changes. (huh.. so {} is a requirement for .setValue()'s arg, makes sense )

-- reactive forms (unlike basic html forms? Max seems to impply this) accept both text & file inputs.

-- Promise <{[key: string]: any}>
Above tells angular not care about name, just needs a property that can be interpreted as a string. Square brackets indicate a "dynamic property name".. not an array. "any" means the value of said property can be anything.

-- Rxjs's Observer is a tool to control when observable assigned to it emits new data.

-- Difference between onload && onloadend is the latter holds more data about the target file.

-- Uint8Array: "Array of 8bit -unsigned(onside??)- integers.
It's "a way to access/read certain patterns in the file & its metadata to be able to parse the mime type.
Dont just want to check the extension, you want to 'infer' the file type while looking into the file"
--> Says this is something that rarely needs to be done on our own, whatev, need to read the docs.

-- Blob is a file object

-- FormData() os an "obj" provided by JS. It's "basicly a data format which allows us to combine text
format & blobs (file values)"

Uploading Image:

-- Connecting & passing data of input type = "file" to back end function:
--> HTML : <input type = "file" (change) = "onNewFileUploaded($event)>
--> TS : onNewFileUploaded(event: Event){
  const file = (event.target as HTMLInputElement).files[0];
  this.form.patchValue({image: file});
  this.form.get('image').updateValueAndValidity;
  // need to tell TS that event.target is an htmlInputElment to avoid erros.
  // .files is an array, it's first array position being the file uploaded.
  // .updateValueAndValidity tells angular to check for new image value & to rerun validiy check.
}

-- Defining preview:

// first declare a proper for the image:

imagePreview: string;

onImageUpload () {

  -- noise --

  const reader = new FileReader;
  reader.onload = () => {
    this.imagePreview = reader.result;
  }

  reader.readAsDataURL(file);

  // reader.onload is a callback. Looks like it's waiting for reader.readAsDataURL to finish reading the uploaded file (& convert to URL?). once reader.onload senses .readAsDataURL is complete it allows it assigns the url (string) value to this.imagePreview using reader.result.
}

mime-type validator (custom validator):


-- ALL validators are functions which "read in controlled value & return the information whether (if valid?) it's valid or not"

-- normal sync validator return a JS object that either holds a key:value pair if returning an error (errorcode: errorvalue) OR null. Null == successful validation.

-- async is similar with the only excepetion being an async return type (Observable/Promise)

Server Side image uploads with Multer:

-- Max installed multer, a livrary that allows extraction of files.

-- Multer should be added to  POST route in backend folder. See, backend for added notes.

-- Unlike front end, Multer automaticly gives you the mime-type.

-- multer(storage).single('image') <-- middleware added to app.post () args?
--> multer, configuration (saved under storage), & expecting single image.
