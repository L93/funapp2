Goal: update post-item with edit button.
Problems:
-- In contacts with back end but posts not updating live. Updates reveal themselves only on refresh. Meaning DB is
updating but not front end. Max is showing us how to have front end display live db info w/ this.
He's choosing to do it w/ ngOnInit, I'm going w/ a f(x) triggered by the button f(x)
-- Front end ID isnt meshing w/ DBs, which is expected but middleware isnt reassinging _id's value to id.
could be the source to many of my headachs.. 
-- + small issues you'll remember while trying to fix prior two.
