Goal: update post-item with edit button.
Problems:
-- In contacts with back end but posts not updating live. Updates reveal themselves only on refresh. Meaning DB is
updating but not front end. Max is showing us how to have front end display live db info w/ this.
He's choosing to do it w/ ngOnInit, I'm going w/ a f(x) triggered by the button f(x)
-- Front end ID isnt meshing w/ DBs, which is expected but middleware isnt reassinging _id's value to id.
could be the source to many of my headachs.. 
-- + small issues you'll remember while trying to fix prior two.

Working thru problem:

-- Looks like "find post by id" is being worked before "update post w/ id"

Solution:

Well, problem sort of resolved. Back-end is functioning well & returning expected variables.
Front end is having issues w/ a split subscription between post-item & data service.
Max continues the subscription for getPost f(x) inside his item component's ngOnInit.
I'm choosing to do it under the onSaveEdit f(x) because variables holding displayed
names hold asyncs that dont play well w/ onInit. Tried apply setTimeout between the trans 
component observables w/o success. Can't put a finger on what the problem is exactly.
Solution was to just update values w/ user input locally & send it to back end seperately
w/o requiring confirmation to update view. We'd have to design. Review lecture 67 in mean course.
